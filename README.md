## Repository Contents

### 1. Laboratory Assignments
The labs provide progressive hands-on experience with core computational intelligence concepts:

- Linear systems and least-squares solutions
- Data analysis and preprocessing with Pandas
- Mathematical function visualization and extrema detection
- Nonlinear optimization using numerical solvers
- Binary and multi-class classification
- Decision boundary visualization
- Neural network training and evaluation

Each lab emphasizes correct problem formulation, implementation clarity, and result interpretation.

### 2. Course Project — Optimization, Deep Learning, and LLMs
The main project is divided into two milestones and focuses on both theoretical understanding and real-world application.

#### Milestone 1 — Neural Network Optimization (MNIST)
- Trains a neural network on handwritten digit data.
- Compares multiple optimizers under the same architecture.
- Includes a custom adaptive learning-rate strategy based on linear search.
- Uses learning curves and confusion matrices to analyze behavior.

#### Milestone 2 — Airbnb Price Prediction with Interpretability
- Treats price prediction as a regression problem.
- Performs deep exploratory data analysis.
- Handles missing data using robust imputation strategies.
- Applies feature scaling and categorical encoding via pipelines.
- Engineers features from amenities to capture luxury indicators.
- Trains a deep neural network with batch normalization and dropout.
- Uses early stopping and learning-rate scheduling.
- Integrates transformer-based Large Language Models to:
  - Perform few-shot price category classification
  - Generate natural-language explanations for predicted prices

LLMs are used to enhance interpretability rather than replace predictive models.
